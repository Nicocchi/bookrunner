## Introduction

`Bookrunner` is an open-source book management system and viewer crafted to be simple to setup and use.

### Why?

Why not make your own tools? While there are great open source tools like Calibre, which also have a third-party front end, I wanted to get more granular control over my books. I wanted to set the design of the site and the structure of the api. While there aren't as many robust features like Calibre has, the ease of use is much better in my opinion.

Everyone loves self hostable projects right? Right...?
